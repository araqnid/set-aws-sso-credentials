/**
 * Removes the locally stored SSO tokens from the client-side cache and sends an API call to
 * the Amazon Web Services SSO service to invalidate the corresponding server-side Amazon Web Services SSO sign in
 * session.
 *
 * If a user uses Amazon Web Services SSO to access the AWS CLI, the userâ€™s Amazon Web Services SSO sign in session is
 * used to obtain an IAM session, as specified in the corresponding Amazon Web Services SSO permission set.
 * More specifically, Amazon Web Services SSO assumes an IAM role in the target account on behalf of the user,
 * and the corresponding temporary Amazon Web Services credentials are returned to the client.
 *
 * After user logout, any existing IAM role sessions that were created by using Amazon Web Services SSO
 * permission sets continue based on the duration configured in the permission set.
 * For more information, see [User authentications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/authconcept.html)
 * in the _Amazon Web Services SSO User Guide_.
